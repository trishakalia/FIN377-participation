This repo gives you a deep dive into all the coding activities and practices conducted through the course of this class. The work fone in the class is segragated into categories:
1. Codebook- consists of personal notes and cheatsheet for this class. This was very helpful to refer back to basics 
2. Homework- includes practice assignments assigned after class  
3. Livecoding- coding conducted during class hours 
4. misc- additional files that did noy belong in any other category

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas 
3. Visualization 
4. Scraping Web Data 
5. Regression 
6. Machine Learning
